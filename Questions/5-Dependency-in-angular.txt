Q5. What is Dependency Injection in Angular

ANS : Dependency Injection in Angular is a way to provide components or services with their its Dependencies from an external
      source rather than creating them internally. it is promoting modularity and testability.


1- Create Service:-

      user.service.ts :

      export class UserService {
        getUser(){
            return "Azeem Khan";
        }
      }

2- Inject the service into component

    app.component.ts :

    import {UserService} from "user.service";

    export class AppComponent {
        user : string;

        constructor(private userServices : UserService){
            this.user = this.userService.getUser();
        }
    }
